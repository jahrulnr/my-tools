### Dockerfile Description

This Dockerfile is designed to build an image for the `mountpoint-s3` project. It uses the Alpine Linux distribution as the base image and sets up a build environment for the project.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the Dockerfile:

1. **Base Image**: The Dockerfile starts by specifying the base image as Alpine Linux version 3.20.
2. **Environment Variables**: It sets the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable to optimize the build process for static linking.
3. **Working Directory**: The working directory is set to `/builder`.
4. **Package Installation**: The Dockerfile installs various packages required for building the project, including GCC, curl, git, and several development tools.
5. **Rust Installation**: It downloads and installs Rust using the `rustup` script.
6. **Project Cloning**: The Dockerfile clones the `mountpoint-s3` project from GitHub, including its submodules.
7. **Working Directory Change**: The working directory is changed to the cloned project directory.
8. **Build Configuration**: The Dockerfile sets up the environment for building the project by sourcing the Rust environment variables and making a modification to the project's source code.
9. **Build**: It builds the project using Cargo in release mode.
10. **Final Image**: The final image is created by copying the built binary from the build environment to the `/usr/sbin/mount-s3` path in the final image.

The resulting Docker image contains the `mount-s3` binary, which can be used for mounting S3 buckets as a file system.
